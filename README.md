This is a userChrome for Firefox that makes Proton compact. This is more of an edit of the UI, nothing new is added or significantly changed. 

There are two versions of this userChrome: Medium and Small. Medium is 67(89) pixels tall, Small is 61(83), and for reference default Proton is 85(113). Parentheses are when the bookmarks bar is shown.

Make sure that you are using "Normal" density, not "Compact (not supported)".

Known bugs: When you press alt the min, max, close buttons don't look right. I don't know how to fix this.
