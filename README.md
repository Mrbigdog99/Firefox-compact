This is a userChrome for Firefox that makes Proton compact. This is more of an edit of the UI, nothing new is added or significantly changed. 

Make sure that you are using "Normal" density, not "Compact (not supported)". 

userChrome - normal is 6 pixels taller then userChrome - compact, so you can decide which one you prefer. 

Known bugs: When you press alt the min, max, close buttons don't look right. I don't know how to fix this.
