This is a userChrome for Firefox that makes Proton compact.

With this userChrome Firefox is 63(85) pixels tall, and for reference default Proton is 85(113). Parentheses are when the bookmarks bar is shown.

Make sure that you are using "Normal" density, not "Compact (not supported)".

Known bugs: 

When you press alt the min, max, close buttons don't look right. I don't know how to fix this.
